This was my first week being an apprentice at 8th light and during this time, I began looking at Git and other basic foundations of a website.

### Git
From my reading about git, I learned that this system is vital to not only being able to collaborate on but also to make changes to your project. Git allows you to experiment without messing up working version of your site; this is called version control.
<br>
<br>
Git was very difficult for me to get used to as it mainly uses the terminal, but is also connected with an online website. There are also many different terms that I needed to get acquainted with such as `git push` and `git commit`. I also got confused while going through other people repos, as I did not understand the set up of the information. I didn't understand that there were so many kinds of files needed for a website, or software.

### Semantics
While learning about HTML and CSS on my own, I was always a little bit confused as to why some elements were used rather than others. Looking into semantics has opened my eyes onto the reasoning behind this. Semantic elements are elements with meaning; they clearly describe their use.
<br>Examples of semantic elements: `<table>`, `<form>`
<br>Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>`, `<span>`

### High Fidelity vs Low Fidelity // Wireframes vs Mockups
This was the first subject that I was asked to do some research about. I knew that there was some sort of framework that went into designing a website, but I had no idea that there were different versions.

### High fidelity // Mockups:
High fidelity means that there is interactivity (responsive to user actions) and it includes of the content and visuals. The benefits of a high fidelity mockup is that it is more realistic and you can test specific components. It also looks more like a "live" version; therefore, it is easier for a client to understand.

### Low fidelity // Wireframes:
Low fidelity means that there is no interactivity and it only includes a summary of the content. The benefits of a low fidelity wireframe is that it takes less time to prepare and you can easily make changes.
<br>
<br>Example of a wireframe:
<img src="/mockup.img" style="width: 500px; margin: auto; align: center;" align="top">

<br>
Overall, my first week at 8th Light was very interesting and full of getting acquainted with the company and the basics.
